# Hotel-Management-System
The tourism industry in Albania has experienced rapid growth due to an ever increasing number of foreign tourists seeking to explore the cultural and archaeological heritage, as well as indulge in the numerous breathtaking landscapes. From the mountainous north to the exotic beaches on the south-west, the diverse landscapes present challenges to the hotel industry due to different accommodation demands. Our goal is to provide the albanian hotel industry with a flexible solution for their needs, hence we are keen on constructing a robust Hotel Management System capable of rising to the challenges of the market.
