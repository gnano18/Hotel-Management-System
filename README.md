# Hotel-Management-System
The tourism industry in Albania has experienced rapid growth due to an ever increasing number of foreign tourists seeking to explore the cultural and archaeological heritage, as well as indulge in the numerous breathtaking landscapes. The diverse terrain, from the mountainous north to the exotic beaches of the south-west, presents accomodational and structural challenges to the hotel industry. Our goal is to provide a solution to tis problem by offering a flexible Management System for hotel owners and managers.
