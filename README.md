# Hotel-Management-System

Albania's tourism industry has experienced a rapid growth eversince the Balkan nation opened its gates to the outside world. The cultural and archaeological heritage, as well as the numerous natural breathtaking landscapes continue attracting an ever-increasing number of tourists eager to explore its treasures. The diverse terrain, from the mountainous north to the exotic beaches of the south-west, presents accomodational and structural challenges to the hotel industry. Our goal is to provide a solution to tis problem by offering a flexible Management System for hotel owners and managers.
